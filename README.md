## HotbarReplace

HotbarReplace is a Minecraft mod for the Fabric modding framework which replaces blocks in your hotbar with blocks of the same type from your inventory.

### Known issues/Improvements

* The mod won't refill your hotbar slot with other stacks in other hotbar slots
* Make the mod more resilient to network delay and packet loss (don't hardcode a 50 ms delay)
* Don't hardcode an offset for the hotbar slot IDs
